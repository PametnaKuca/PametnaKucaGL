config_schema:

 - ["wifi.sta.enable", true]

# - ["debug.level", 2]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", get_cfg()->device.id);
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/sys_config.c or build/gen/sys_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
